# style_transfer

## This is a keras implementation of Style Transfer of images.

## It takes in a list of frames extracted from a video and applies style transfer to it based on the style images provided.

## style_transfer_keras.ipynb is the jupyter notebook which consists of the code to transfer the styles of the frames of the video.

## Losses taken into account:
1. Style loss
2. Content loss
3. Total variation loss
4. Stabilization loss
